# Terry Stops Arrest Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes Terry Stop data to predict whether an arrest was made after a stop, based on details of the stop, subject, and officer. The analysis is sensitive because insights may inform policy and operational decisions regarding police interactions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Police departments and policymakers need insights into the factors influencing arrests during Terry Stops. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to build a predictive model that:
- Identifies key factors influencing arrests.
- Ensures fairness by avoiding the use of sensitive attributes like race and gender.
- Provides actionable insights to support ethical and data-driven decision-making.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset includes information on:
- **Stop details** (e.g., reported year, presence of weapons, frisk flag).
- **Subject details** (e.g., age group).
- **Outcome** (arrest made or not).

Target variable: `arrest_flag` (1 = Arrest made, 0 = No arrest).

## ðŸ”„ Data Preprocessing
Steps applied:
- **Encoding:** Label Encoding (`subject_age_group`), One-Hot Encoding (other categorical variables).
- **Scaling:** StandardScaler applied to numerical features.
- **Class imbalance:** Addressed using **SMOTE** to balance arrests vs non-arrests.
- **Sensitive attributes:** Race and gender were excluded to avoid bias in modeling.

## ðŸ¤– Modeling
We compared four models:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  

### Key Results
| Model            | Accuracy | Recall (Arrest=1) | ROC-AUC |
|------------------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Logistic Reg     | 0.931    | 0.58              | 0.914   |
| Decision Tree    | 0.934    | 0.52              | 0.726   |
| Random Forest    | 0.948    | 0.68              | 0.931   |
| XGBoost          | 0.941    | 0.69              | 0.933   |

### Final Model
- **Chosen Model:** XGBoost  
- **Reasoning:** Balanced performance across metrics with strong recall (important for correctly identifying arrests).  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Improved accuracy to 0.944 and ROC-AUC to 0.934, though recall slightly decreased to 0.68.  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- **Weapon presence** was one of the strongest predictors of arrest.  
- **Frisk flag** and **subject age group** also played important roles in predicting outcomes.  
- Sensitive features (race, gender) were tested but excluded from the final model to maintain fairness.  

## ðŸ“Š Conclusions
- Arrest outcomes are strongly influenced by risk-related factors such as weapon presence.  
- Machine learning models, especially **XGBoost**, can effectively predict arrests with high accuracy.  
- Fair modeling practices are essential â€” excluding sensitive variables avoids biased outcomes.  

## âœ… Recommendations
- **Policy:** Focus resources on higher-risk stop situations (e.g., weapon-related) where arrests are more likely.  
- **Ethics:** Continue avoiding sensitive demographic features in predictive modeling.  
- **Future Work:** Explore methods to further improve recall (catching more true arrests) such as adjusting thresholds or applying cost-sensitive learning.
